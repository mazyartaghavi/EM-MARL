## 📝 Abstract

We propose an Expectation-Maximization-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (EM-MARL) framework to enable a team of UAVs to collaboratively monitor and protect endangered wildlife (e.g., the Iranian leopard) from illegal poaching activities. By modeling latent variables representing inter-agent knowledge and intent, our algorithm dynamically adapts to partial observability and environmental uncertainties. We demonstrate superior performance over classical MARL approaches like PPO and DDPG across various metrics including detection rate, convergence speed, and robustness.
